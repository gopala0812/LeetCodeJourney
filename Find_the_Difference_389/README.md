## Problem: Find the Difference (LeetCode #389)

**Difficulty:** Easy
**Language:** Java
**Topic:** Bit Manipulation / String

**Problem Statement:**

You are given two strings s and t. String t is generated by shuffling string s and adding one extra letter at a random position.
Your task is to return the letter that was added to t.

**Example:**
```
Input: s = "abcd", t = "abcde"
Output: 'e'

Input: s = "", t = "y"
Output: 'y'

Input: s = "a", t = "aa"
Output: 'a'

```
**Solution:**

1.The key idea is to use the XOR (Exclusive OR) operation, which cancels out identical characters because x ^ x = 0.

2.XOR all characters from both strings — the common ones will cancel each other out.

3.The remaining value after all XOR operations corresponds to the extra character’s ASCII value.

4.Convert that numeric value back to a character and return it.

5.This approach runs in O(n) time and uses O(1) space.
